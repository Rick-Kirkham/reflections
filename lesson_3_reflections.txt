When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When someone who doesn't have access to my machine is working on the same repo

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some commits on the remote might be bad and will be reversed soon.
